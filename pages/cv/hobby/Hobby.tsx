        A great work-life balance makes a efficient developer! Beside staring at
        my laptop all day, I lot of random stuffs, some of them are listed below
        (excuse my language in some of the videos *emoji*):

        <h3>Calisthenics (Street workout)</h3>
        <p>
          Calisthenics is about doing bodyweight exercises to achieve bodily
          fitness and grace of movement. I have been training with this sport
          for quite some time and absolutely love it.

          I am not good at taking breaks, except while traveling - I would do
          nothing else than chilling. I am not the best at saving money, mostly
          because I travel whenever I have the chance. Honestly, I have no
          regrets :)
